# Open Weather API Weather Dashboard

This project gives users an opportunity to select a city and quickly see the current weather
in that city and to see a quick 5-day forecast in a snapshot, easy-to-read format.

# Motivation

This project was completed as part of the Michigan State University/Trilogy Web Development Bootcamp Program.
The goal was to practice skills in JavaScript, jQuery, dynamically produced HTML, CSS3, and 
API GET methods. 

# Features

The app takes in user queries and produces two sets of data: one for the current weather in the queried location and another
for the five-day forecast for that same location. 

The current weather lists the conditions, temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet index (UVI).

The five-day weather forecast includes a visual representation of the conditions, the temperature, and humidity.
