# open-weather-api-weather-dashboard
This project gives users an opportunity to select a city and quickly see the current weather
in that city and to see a quick 5-day forecast in a snapshot, easy-to-read format.

To complete this project I further developed my skills in javascript, jQuery, html, and CSS, and 
began using API GET methods for the first time. 

Over the course of this project, I also moved away from using nested functions becuase of the difficulties 
of trying to retrieve data from those nested functions. I also spend more attention to initializing my
javascript before starting it up.
